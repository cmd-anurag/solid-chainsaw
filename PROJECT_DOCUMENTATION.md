## Root README
CD-STAR is a role-based MERN application that lets students upload achievements, teachers verify them, and admins manage users and institutional data. It ships with a JWT-secured Express API, a Vite + Tailwind dashboard UI, and a simple Context API state layer.

**Project structure**
```
MERNproject
├── client/             # React + Vite frontend
├── server/             # Express + MongoDB backend
├── package.json        # root scripts (dev, client, server)
└── README.md
```

**Backend (server/)**
- Tech: Express, Mongoose, JWT, Multer, bcrypt, CORS, Morgan.
- Models: User, Activity, Academics, Attendance.
- Auth: /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login with JWT + role middleware.
- Student APIs: list/add activities, fetch profile (academics + attendance).
%- Teacher APIs: list pending activities, approve/reject submissions.
- Admin APIs: list/add/delete users.
- Uploads: Multer stores PDF/image certificates under server/uploads/.

Env (server/.env):
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cdstar
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

Backend run:
```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Frontend (client/)**
- Tech: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios, Context API.
- Features: student dashboard, upload form, activity list with filters, profile view; teacher overview + pending approvals; admin overview + user management; protected routes; Axios auth header + persistence.

Env (client/.env):
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Frontend run:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Root scripts**
```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run client
npm run server
```

**API summary**
| Role | Method & Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | POST /api/auth/register | Register a new user (default student) |
|  | POST /api/auth/login | Login and get JWT |
| Student | GET /api/student/activities | List own activities |
|  | POST /api/student/activity/add | Upload activity + certificate |
|  | GET /api/student/profile | Profile + academics + attendance |
| Teacher | GET /api/teacher/activities/pending | Pending activities to verify |
|  | PUT /api/teacher/activity/approve/:id | Approve activity |
|  | PUT /api/teacher/activity/reject/:id | Reject activity |
| Admin | GET /api/admin/users | List users (optional role filter) |
|  | POST /api/admin/user/add | Create user |
|  | DELETE /api/admin/user/delete/:id | Remove user |

Development tips: Tailwind preconfigured; Axios injects JWT; uploads served from /uploads; extend models/routes as needed.

## Implementation Summary: Academic Records & Marks System
Extended the MERN app with academic records management, SGPA/CGPA calculations, teacher permissions, and search filters.

**Files Created (Backend)**
- AcademicRecord model; TeacherAssignment model.
- grades.js utilities + grades.test.js.
- academicRecordsController.js and routes/academicRecords.js.
- permissionMiddleware.js.
- migration script migrate-add-teacher-role.js.
- jest.config.js.

**Files Created (Frontend)**
- Page: AcademicPerformance.jsx.
- Components: AcademicRecordForm.jsx, MarksTable.jsx, CGPAProgress.jsx, SGPAChart.jsx.

**Files Modified (Backend)**
- User model: rollNumber, permissions.
- adminController: search filters, permissions endpoint.
- teacherController: getAssignedStudents.
- adminRoutes, teacherRoutes, index.js (mount routes), server package.json (Jest, scripts).

**Files Modified (Frontend)**
- Profile.jsx: tabs with Academic Performance.
- ManageUsers.jsx: search filters (role, regNo, CGPA min/max, SGPA < / >).

**API Endpoints Added**
- Academic records CRUD and CGPA endpoints.
- PUT /api/users/:id/permissions (admin).
- GET /api/teachers/:id/students.
- Enhanced GET /api/admin/users with filters.

**Features**
- Semester-based records, totals, SGPA/CGPA.
- Charts (SGPA trend, CGPA bar).
- Permission system (viewMarks/editMarks), students see own.
- Search and filters (CGPA, SGPA, regNo, role).
- Teacher-student assignment model.

**Setup**
```
cd server && npm install && npm run migrate && npm run dev
cd client && npm install && npm run dev
cd server && npm test
```

Notes: CommonJS maintained; charts via Canvas; validation on marks/SGPA/CGPA; indexes on student and rollNumber; migration adds permissions.

## Advanced Features Implementation
- Advanced analytics dashboard (/admin/analytics): overview metrics, trends, user distribution, tabs.
- Real-time notifications (polling 30s) with types, unread counts, mark read/all, delete.
- Audit logging middleware (user, IP, UA, status, metadata).
- Custom data visualization (line, bar, pie, doughnut).

**Analytics Endpoints**
- GET /api/analytics/overview | activities | academics | users.

**Notification Endpoints**
- GET /api/notifications?limit=&unreadOnly=
- POST /api/notifications (admin)
- PUT /api/notifications/:id/read
- PUT /api/notifications/read-all
- DELETE /api/notifications/:id

UI: notification bell; advanced charts; tabbed analytics; responsive.

Security: audit logging, admin-only analytics, input validation, proper errors.

Performance: indexed queries, aggregation pipelines, polling optimization, lazy loading.

Future: export, bulk ops, advanced search, predictions, dark mode, websockets, advanced permissions, reports, backups.

Technical additions: Notification.js, AuditLog.js; analyticsController, notificationController; auditMiddleware; Analytics page, AdvancedChart, NotificationBell; routes /admin/analytics and /api/analytics/*, /api/notifications/*.

Examples included for creating notifications and fetching analytics.

## Implementation Checklist
Backend models/utilities/controllers/routes/middleware/scripts/tests added; frontend pages/components added; package updates; install/test commands.

**API Summary (Academic Records/Admin/Teacher)**
- POST/GET/PUT/DELETE marks endpoints.
- PUT /api/users/:id/permissions.
- GET /api/teachers/:id/students.

Security & permissions: auth everywhere, permission middleware, students view own, validation and error handling.

Testing: unit tests for grade calculations.

Files created/modified list (backend/frontend/docs).

Next steps: PDF export, subject trend charts, bulk import, grade analytics, frontend tests.

## Classroom Architecture & Data Flow
- Frontend pages/components for classrooms and assignments.
- Backend routes/controllers/middleware/models for classrooms, assignments, submissions.
- Mongo collections: classrooms, assignments, submissions, users, notifications.

**Data Flow**
- Assignment creation/publish lifecycle with auto submissions.
- Submission and grading flow with notifications.
- Classroom management flow (list, view, add/remove students).

**Permission Matrix**
